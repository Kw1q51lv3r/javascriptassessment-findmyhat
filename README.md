# javascriptassessment-findmyhat

I'll be honest, the most enjoyable and easiest part of this project was that not only had hundreds of people already done this exact same project, but Codecademy had already put up an easily-indexed reference project for the entire internet to look at and reverse engineer. So: most of the code in this project that wasn't already provided is reverse-engineered. This was a far more fruitful pursuit than pulling my own teeth out for a good four hours trying to figure out how to fill an array with randomly-placed single values and getting absolutely nowhere; to be honest, I wouldn't even have begun to be able to complete this project if I didn't have existing work to refer to. It would've been very easy to just lift the entire block from somewhere else wholesale and refactor everything but that's no fun; it's very easy to be hemmed in by horse blinders when you're focused on trying to do something, and how someone else has arrived at a solution can be very refreshing when you've been treading water.
